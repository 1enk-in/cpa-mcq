          "choice": "C",
          "text": "In order to file a joint return, the parties must be married at the end of the year. Exception: If the parties are married but are legally separated under the laws of the state in which they reside, they cannot file a joint return (they will file either under the single or head of household filing status).\n\nChoice \"C\" is correct. Taxpayers who are married but lived apart during the year are allowed to file a joint return for the year. The fact that they did not live together during the year has no bearing on the issue.\n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect. Taxpayers who are married but lived under a legal separation agreement at the end of the year may not file a joint return. They will generally file either under the single or head of household filing status.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. Taxpayers who were divorced during the year may not file a joint return together, as they are not married at the end of the year. [Note, however, that they may become married again in the year and file a joint return with the new spouse.]\n\nChoice \"D\" is incorrect. Taxpayers who were legally separated but lived together for the entire year may not file a joint return. They will generally file either under the single or head of household filing status.\n\n===QUESTION===\nA taxpayer's spouse dies in August of the current year. Which of the following is the taxpayer's filing status for the current year?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nHead of household.\n\nB.Option B.\t\nSingle.\n\nC.Option C.\t\nMarried filing jointly.\n\nD.Option D.\t\nQualifying surviving spouse.\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is C.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"C\" is correct. The surviving spouse is considered to be married (and thus able to file as married filing jointly) for the entire current year even if the spouse dies earlier in the year (in this case in August).\n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect. The filing status is not head of household for the current year.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. The filing status is not single for the current year.\n\nChoice \"D\" is incorrect. The filing status is not qualifying surviving spouse for the current year.\n\n===QUESTION===\nTaylor, an individual, commenced business on August 4 of this year. Taylor does not keep adequate records. On which of the following dates must Taylor's tax year end?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nJuly 31\n\nB.Option B.\t\nAugust 3\n\nC.Option C.\t\nAugust 31\n\nD.Option D.\t\nDecember 31\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is D.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"D\" is correct. Because Taylor is an individual, Taylor is required to use a calendar year as her tax year. As such, Taylor's tax year will end on December 31.\n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect. Because Taylor is an individual, she is not permitted to use a fiscal year as her tax year; rather, she must use a calendar year ending on December 31 as her tax year. The fact that she started business on August 4, or that she does not keep adequate records, is irrelevant.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. Because Taylor is an individual, Taylor is not permitted to use a fiscal year as her tax year. As such, Taylor cannot choose an end date for her tax year other than December 31, regardless of the fact that her business started in August.\n\nChoice \"C\" is incorrect. Because Taylor is an individual, she is required to use a calendar year as her tax year. As such, her tax year will end on December 31. The fact that she started her business in the middle of the year and that she keeps inadequate records is irrelevant.\n\n===QUESTION===\nJohn and Theresa are in the process of obtaining a divorce. Although they are not legally separated, John moved out of the family home in October of Year 1 and moved into an apartment nearby. John and Theresa's two children, Jenna and Stella, lived with Theresa in the family home for more than half of the tax year. What filing status can Theresa use to file her Year 1 tax return?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nQualifying surviving spouse.\n\nB.Option B.\t\nSingle.\n\nC.Option C.\t\nHead of household.\n\nD.Option D.\t\nMarried filing jointly/separately.\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is D.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"D\" is correct. John and Theresa are still married at year-end, not legally separated, and have not lived apart for the last six months of the taxable year. Theresa must file as married, but may choose to do so either jointly with John or separately.\n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect. Qualifying surviving spouse is not an option for Theresa, as John is still alive.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. Filing as single is not an option, because John and Theresa are still married and not legally separated at year-end.\n\nChoice \"C\" is incorrect. Head of household status is not an option because the couple is not legally separated at year-end and John did not live apart from Theresa for the last six months of the taxable year.\n\n===QUESTION===\nMort and Mindy met at a New Year's Eve party held December 31, Year 1. They instantly bonded, fell madly in love, and were married at 11:38 p.m. that night. Sadly, Mort passed away November 15, Year 2. What filing status should Mindy use for Year 2?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nSingle.\n\nB.Option B.\t\nMarried filing jointly.\n\nC.Option C.\t\nHead of household.\n\nD.Option D.\t\nSurviving spouse.\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is B.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"B\" is correct. Mindy will be able to use the married filing jointly status for the year Mort passed away (Year 2) even though she was not married at year-end.\n\nChoices \"A\", \"C\", and \"D\" are incorrect, based on the above explanation.\n\n===QUESTION===\nThompson's spouse died in Year 1. Thompson did not remarry in Year 2 and lived alone the entire year. What is Thompson's Year 2 filing status?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nSingle.\n\nB.Option B.\t\nHead of household.\n\nC.Option C.\t\nQualifying surviving spouse.\n\nD.Option D.\t\nMarried filing jointly.\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is A.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"A\" is correct. Filing status is determined as of the last day of the year. At the end of Year 2, Thompson is not married and does not qualify for any other filing status. Therefore, his status is single.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. Head of household status could apply in certain circumstances where there is a dependent and surviving spouse status does not apply. That is not the case here. Thompson is single for Year 2.\n\nChoice \"C\" is incorrect. Qualifying surviving spouse status, can be claimed for the two years after year of death. However, it requires the presence of a dependent child, which is not part of the facts here. Thompson is single for Year 2.\n\nChoice \"D\" is incorrect. When a spouse dies during the year, the surviving spouse can file married filing jointly for that year under an exception to the end-of-year test. But this question is about Year 2, the year after death. Thompson is single for Year 2.\n\n===QUESTION===\nAs of December 31, the Mitchells were legally separated and maintained separate households for the entire year. The Mitchells have no children. What filing status should Mr. Mitchell claim for the year?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nMarried filing jointly\n\nB.Option B.\t\nMarried filing separately\n\nC.Option C.\t\nHead of household\n\nD.Option D.\t\nSingle\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is D.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"D\" is correct. Marital status for the tax year is determined as of the last day of the year. Taxpayers who are divorced or legally separated are considered unmarried. Mr. Mitchell is legally separated and does not have a qualifying dependent, so Mr. Mitchell's filing status for the year is single.\n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect. Because the taxpayer is legally separated, he is considered unmarried and does not qualify for married-filing-jointly filing status.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. Because the taxpayer is legally separated, he is considered unmarried and does not qualify for married-filing-separately filing status.\n\nChoice \"C\" is incorrect. The taxpayer does not qualify for head-of-household filing status because he does not maintain a home for a qualifying dependent.\n\n===QUESTION===\nIn which of the following scenarios would the head of household filing status be available to the taxpayer?\n===OPTIONS===\nA.Option A.\t\nA single taxpayer maintains a household that is the principal home for five months of the year for his disabled child.\n\nB.Option B.\t\nAn unmarried taxpayer maintains a household with a 28-year-old son, who earned $10,000 during the tax year.\n\nC.Option C.\t\nA single taxpayer maintains a separate home for his parent, who qualifies as a dependent.\n\nD.Option D.\t\nA taxpayer with no dependents is the surviving spouse of an individual who died in the current year.\n===CORRECT===\n the correct answer is C.\n===EXPLANATION===\nExplanation\nChoice \"C\" is correct. Head of household filing status is available to a single taxpayer who maintains a separate home for a dependent parent. To qualify for head of household filing status, a taxpayer must be unmarried as of the last day of the tax year and maintain a home that is the principal residence of a qualifying person for more than half of the tax year. A qualifying person includes a dependent child, parent, or relative. A dependent parent is not required to live with the taxpayer, provided the taxpayer maintains a home that was the principal residence of the parent for the entire year.\n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect. The taxpayer is not entitled to head of household filing status. His filing status is single. To qualify for head of household status, the taxpayer must maintain a home that is the principal residence of a qualifying person for more than half the year. Because the taxpayer maintains a household that is the principal home for his disabled child for only five months of the year, his son is not a dependent child or relative and he does not qualify for head of household status.\n\nChoice \"B\" is incorrect. The taxpayer is not entitled to head of household filing status. Her filing status is single. The taxpayer is unmarried and maintains a home for her son, but her son is not a dependent child or dependent relative. Her son is not a qualifying child dependent because he is over the age limit (under age 19, or under age 24 in the case of a full-time student). He is not a qualifying relative dependent because his gross income of $10,000 is more than the gross income threshold amount.\n\nChoice \"D\" is incorrect. A taxpayer who has no dependents is not entitled to head of household filing status. Because the taxpayer's spouse died in the current year, the taxpayer is entitled to married filing jointly status for the current year."
